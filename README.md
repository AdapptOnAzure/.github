# What is AdapptOnAzure?

AdapptOnAzure is an internal project run by [Adappt](https://adappt.ai). With well over a decade of experience delivering enterprise grade solutions that work for you, and with the trust of blue chip companies and global NGOs, we are proud to share a little bit of the work we do on a daily basis to meet the unique and sophisticated needs of our clientel. We build platforms that work to your needs, on your terms, tailored to your needs.

# Get Involved

Projects here are open to all contributions. Commits need to be made in a neat and atomic fashion, and we generally aim to look for incremental improvements rather than complete overhauls when it comes to contributions.

We aim to licence all code under a permission licence, with a preference for dual licencing under the Apache2 + MIT licence, as is commonly seen within the Rust community.

# Security

In the event of a security issue being located, we urge you to get in touch with us on our security contact which you find by executing the below command in your TTY of choice:

```echo "c2VjdXJpdHlAYWRhcHB0LmFpCg==" | base64 -d```

We aim to respond to all security matters within 24 hours. We ask for your confidentiality during disclosure of issues, and to please refrain from open disclosure until we have fully triaged the matter. We aim to abide by and uphold similar goals and values to those of Google TAG and Project Zero. You may find their policy [here](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/p/vulnerability-disclosure-policy.html).
